he2325u reads measurements from the UT61 series DMM's from Uni-Trend.

I have modified the original he2325u for UT61E made by Rainer Wetzel
http://diyftw.de/wiki/doku.php?id=projekte:ut61e

The modification I made makes it work with models UT61B, UT61C, UT61D.
It's possible that it still works with UT61E too but I can't verify it.

The executable file he2325u is compiled ond works on my 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04
