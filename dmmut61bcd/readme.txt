dmmut61bcd.pl

This is a modified version of dmmut61b originally written byt H.P. Stroebel
http://hps.ininter.net/content/index.php?cat=80_English&page=40_Uni-T-nbsp~UT61B-nbsp~Linux

I have modified the original script to take input from stdin instead of serial port so that it can be used together with he2325u.
I have only tested it with the UT61D but it should work with UT61B, UT61C too.
